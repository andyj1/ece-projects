#### ECE164: Data Structures and Algorithms I
> 1. Stack and Queue: Program that manipulates stacks and queues to process push/pop operations in order
> 2. Sorting: Program that sorts the nodes of a linked list. Each of the inputs (T1, T2, T3, T4) has different sizes, data types, sorted order, digits, so different algorithm is applied by the data

#### ECE165: Data Structures and Algorithms II
> 1. Hash Table: Uses a hash table to read in a 'dictionary' input file and spell checks a 'document' input file
> 2. Heap: Uses a priority queue using a binary heap implementation
> 3. Dijkstra: Implements Dijkstra's algorithm to solve the single-source shortest-path problem, using hash table and heap (priority queue) from parts 1 and 2
> 4. Merge: Uses dynamic programming to verify if a word is merged from two subsequence words. This was an ACM Programming Contest problem in 1998 (http://www.acmgnyr.org/year1998/prob_g.html)
